# Memory Management

JanetSharp bridges two garbage collectors — .NET's and Janet's. Understanding how they interact prevents leaks and crashes.

## How It Works

Janet uses a tracing garbage collector. When a Janet value (string, array, table, function, etc.) has no references from Janet's root set, it gets collected. But C# code may still hold a reference — if Janet collects it, the C# side gets a dangling pointer.

`JanetValue` solves this by **rooting** values in Janet's GC when created and **unrooting** them when disposed:

```csharp
// JanetValue roots the array in Janet's GC
using var arr = JanetArray.Create();

// The array is safe from Janet GC as long as 'arr' is alive
arr.Add(Janet.From(1.0));

// Dispose unroots it — Janet GC can now collect it
```

## What Needs Rooting

**Primitives do NOT need rooting** — they are encoded entirely within the 64-bit NaN-box:
- `Janet.From(42.0)` — number, no allocation
- `Janet.From(true)` — boolean, no allocation
- `Janet.Nil` — nil, no allocation

**Reference types DO need rooting** — they point to Janet heap memory:
- `JanetString`, `JanetSymbol`, `JanetKeyword`
- `JanetArray`, `JanetTuple`
- `JanetTable`, `JanetStruct`
- `JanetBuffer`
- `JanetFunction`, `JanetCallback`

All `JanetValue` subclasses handle rooting automatically. You just need to dispose them.

## The Dispose Pattern

Always use `using` to ensure timely disposal:

```csharp
using var runtime = new JanetRuntime();

// Good: 'using' ensures disposal
using var arr = JanetArray.Create();
using var tbl = JanetTable.Create();
using var fn = runtime.GetFunction("+");

// Also good: explicit dispose
var buf = JanetBuffer.Create(64);
// ... use buf ...
buf.Dispose();
```

### What Happens If You Don't Dispose

If a `JanetValue` is not explicitly disposed, its finalizer will unroot it when the .NET GC collects it. This works but has caveats:

1. **Non-deterministic timing** — the value stays rooted until the .NET GC runs, consuming Janet memory longer than necessary.
2. **Runtime lifetime** — the finalizer checks that the same runtime is still active before unrooting. If the runtime was already disposed, the finalizer safely skips the unroot call (no crash, but the memory was already freed by `janet_deinit`).

## The Generation Counter

JanetSharp uses a generation counter to handle a subtle race condition:

```
Runtime A created (generation 1)
  → JanetValue X created, records generation 1
Runtime A disposed (calls janet_deinit — all Janet memory freed)
Runtime B created (generation 2)
  → .NET GC runs, finalizes JanetValue X
  → X checks: generation 1 ≠ current generation 2 → skips unroot (safe!)
```

Without this check, `JanetValue X` would call `shim_gcunroot` on Runtime B's heap with a pointer from Runtime A — an access violation.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Disposing Too Early

```csharp
// WRONG: callback disposed before Janet can call it
var cb = runtime.Register("my-func", args => Janet.Nil);
cb.Dispose();
runtime.Eval("(my-func)"); // undefined behavior!

// RIGHT: keep it alive
using var cb2 = runtime.Register("my-func", args => Janet.Nil);
runtime.Eval("(my-func)"); // works
```

### 2. Using After Dispose

```csharp
var arr = JanetArray.Create();
arr.Dispose();
arr.Add(Janet.From(1.0)); // throws ObjectDisposedException
```

### 3. Accessing Raw Janet Values After Runtime Disposal

Raw `Janet` values (the struct, not `JanetValue`) are just 64-bit numbers. They're safe to hold but meaningless after the runtime is disposed — the memory they point to is freed:

```csharp
Janet raw;
using (var runtime = new JanetRuntime())
{
    raw = runtime.Eval("\"hello\"");
    // raw.AsString() works here
}
// raw.AsString() — undefined behavior! The string memory is freed.
```

### 4. Thread Safety

Janet is single-threaded. All runtime access must happen on the thread that created the `JanetRuntime`:

```csharp
using var runtime = new JanetRuntime();

// WRONG: accessing from another thread
Task.Run(() => runtime.Eval("(+ 1 2)")); // throws InvalidOperationException

// RIGHT: stay on the creating thread
var result = runtime.Eval("(+ 1 2)");
```

## Runtime Disposal Order

When disposing the runtime, JanetSharp flushes pending finalizers before shutting down Janet:

```
JanetRuntime.Dispose()
  → GC.Collect()                    // trigger finalizers for unreachable JanetValues
  → GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()   // wait for unroot calls to complete
  → shim_deinit()                   // now safe to shut down Janet
```

This ensures that any `JanetValue` objects that went out of scope but weren't explicitly disposed still get properly unrooted before `janet_deinit` frees all Janet memory.

## Summary

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Always dispose `JanetValue` objects | Frees Janet GC roots promptly |
| Use `using` declarations | Guarantees disposal even on exceptions |
| Keep callbacks alive while in use | Janet holds a raw function pointer |
| Don't use raw `Janet` after runtime disposal | Underlying memory is freed |
| Stay on the creating thread | Janet is not thread-safe |
